This repository is my solution to Problem #2 of Project Euler+ on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).

The challenge is to find the sum of all even-valued Fibonacci whose values do not exceed a given number *N*. Input to the program is provided as integers separated by newlines, where the first number *T* denotes the number of test cases.  The program must produce the correct output for each number *N* that follows, within a specified time limit.

I wrote my solution in Java.  In order to meet the time limit, I created a hashMap of already-solved Fibonacci in order to save time on future runs.
